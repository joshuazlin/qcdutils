Forked from https://github.com/mdipierro/qcdutils

Changes 
 - Partially ported from Python2 to Python3
 - Added 'npy' format, for saving to a numpy array. The shape is [4,LX,LY,LZ,LT,3,3], where the first index is the link direction. 

Things that work:
  >> python3 qcdutils_get.py -c npy filename
  >> python3 qcdutils_get.py -c ildg filename
where filename points to a NERSC configuration, in IEEE64LITTLE. Other input/output types not guarenteed to work (likely will fail due to incomplete porting)
