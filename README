Changes 
 - Ported from Python2 to Python3
 - Added 'npy' format, for saving to a numpy array. The shape is [4,LX,LY,LZ,LT,3,3], where the first index is the link direction. 

Only thing tested that works is:
  >> python3 qcdutils_get.py -c npy filename
where filename points to a NERSC configuration, in IEEE64LITTLE. Other inputs should work, but code may need to be changed.
